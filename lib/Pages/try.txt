If you want to create a chat-like interface between the web and the Flutter app using the recommendation API, you'll need to establish real-time communication between the two platforms. One common approach is to use a WebSocket-based solution.

Here's a high-level overview of how you can implement this:

1. **WebSocket Server**: Set up a WebSocket server that acts as a communication bridge between the web and the Flutter app. This server will handle incoming connections from both the web and the app and facilitate the exchange of messages.

2. **WebSocket Client (Web)**: Implement WebSocket client functionality in your web application to connect to the WebSocket server. When a new recommendation is received from the doctor's API, send it to the WebSocket server, which will relay it to the connected Flutter app.

3. **WebSocket Client (Flutter)**: Implement WebSocket client functionality in your Flutter app to connect to the WebSocket server. When a new message is received from the server, display it in the chat interface.

Here's a basic example of how you can set up WebSocket communication in Flutter using the `web_socket_channel` package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:web_socket_channel/web_socket_channel.dart';
import 'package:web_socket_channel/io.dart';

class ChatScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _ChatScreenState createState() => _ChatScreenState();
}

class _ChatScreenState extends State<ChatScreen> {
  final TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();
  final WebSocketChannel channel = IOWebSocketChannel.connect('ws://echo.websocket.org');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Chat'),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: <Widget>[
          Flexible(
            child: StreamBuilder(
              stream: channel.stream,
              builder: (context, snapshot) {
                return Padding(
                  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
                  child: Text(snapshot.hasData ? '${snapshot.data}' : ''),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
            child: TextField(
              controller: _controller,
              onSubmitted: _sendMessage,
              decoration: InputDecoration(
                labelText: 'Send a message...',
                suffixIcon: IconButton(
                  onPressed: () => _sendMessage(_controller.text),
                  icon: Icon(Icons.send),
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  void _sendMessage(String text) {
    if (text.isNotEmpty) {
      channel.sink.add(text);
    }
    _controller.clear();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    channel.sink.close();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

In this example:

- We establish a WebSocket connection with the `echo.websocket.org` server.
- Messages received from the server are displayed in the chat interface using a `StreamBuilder`.
- The user can type a message in the `TextField` and send it by tapping the send button. The message is then sent to the server via the WebSocket channel.

You'll need to replace `'ws://echo.websocket.org'` with the actual URL of your WebSocket server. Additionally, you'll need to implement the WebSocket server on your backend to handle incoming connections and relay messages between the web and Flutter clients.
